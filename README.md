# Bulls&Cows
A game that generates 4 unique numbers and a player tries to guess them.

If he guesses a right number and a position, he gets a bull, if he guesses just the number, he gets a cow.

When he gets 3 or more bulls the game ends.

While playing the game, the program is clocking the time and at the end it saves the time and a number of guesses the player needed to win to a file which it can later read from and show a history of results.
